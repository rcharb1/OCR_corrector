Suddenly someone shouted that there was a feakin the ship and water was cant, in. Everyone was rafted down to pump the water out.

Our captain continued firinggwts fin.ftelP.Iftem was a small ship in front of us whith sent us a from. The sailors on that boat risked their Goes but managed to reach our ship. 'With". difficulty we all boarded the boat. We couldn't thinkof going backto their ship which was very far way day.

When we fitnaffy reaches 1,e land we were treated with great kindness. ?he focal people helped . find rooms and gave. money to get to London or go backto If I had had any sense, I would have gone home then. Hearing that , ship had sunk ,father must have been ettremely worried about me. Even my friend, the son of the owner c f the ship, thought I should go back,home and nevergo to sea again. I met him and his father

I owe., to London by fand 'The whole way I was wondering what to do and when toga. I was too ashamed of myself to go back home. In London I met the captain of another ship who had already been to the coast of guinea before. gfe offered. to tmvel with him and be his companion for the journey. As I stiff had some money, I those to trate las a passenger and not as a sailor. The captain of the ship also promised me that he would carry backto England any treasure I might make in Africa. 'When leaving London, he advised me what to buy for trade in Africa. At the time 1 only .1140 which I managed to get with the assistance of , relatives.,lltis journey was my only successful one because I returned to England with some gold dust which was worth almost £300.7he joamey was also good forme beuthse the captain taught me a bit about mathematics and navigation. I learned what ums necessary in ender to become a sailor and a merchant. Sa4 this trip wasn't perfect. I was constantly sickand had ever. Soon after we came backto Eng. u friend, the captain, died decided to male the same journey with the same ship backto Guinea. !left 1200 with the widow of my frier,so I had only I100 to trade in Africa. This was one of the unhappiest journeys a man has ever taken. The first disaster happened when we were between the Canary Islands and the African shore.

Chapter 5 
Matt of m yfame men were carried, the emperor's court, but because I tens young an d strong I remained as a slave to the captain of the pirates. I file very sad but this was only the beginning c f ^uJ troubles. I was hoping , new master would take me with him when he went to sea; and when a „Spanish or a Portuguese captain attacked him, I woad be set free. Yet this tuf not happen because my master left me to fookafter ! s Baden every time he watt to sea. Ispent two years hoping to escape. Sometimes when, master wentftsh, he weal take me and .other young man to help him. Sometime, he woad even send me and the young man with one of his relatives fish in a smaff boat. One morning when we were fishing, a thick fog rose and we were thst. Ytk struggled to reach the shore the whole day and the following night, but it teas only the nett morning that we finally got back After this adventure, my master decided to use a bigger boat, the one from our English ship, and make it more comfortable.. had a cabin built in the middle of it and installed f .,ome additional sailing One day, master ordered' me to put extra food and drin4 as vxliasg.s with parader on the boat as he taus reeding some distinguishedguesth to join him for fishing. They also intended to do some thin., after.ods. However, theguests refused the offer at the fast moment, and , master let his retat., myself, and the boygo fishing as USWl. MC., master tad me this, I remembered all my plans for escape and prepared the boat not for fishing but fora journey. I convinced the captain's rehrtive to bring more food, pretend, that we shouldn't eat our master's food I secretly twig& some more bottles and additional gear such as a rope, a hammer; and a big fun, of beesuakfor =king candles. I also asked' the captain's relative for powder and buffets, again &Mg that we needed them to shoot bin,for my master's tube. Soon we were at sea, and I pretended I couldn't catch any ftsh.This tray I persuaded the others toga farther out to sea. The captain:, relative went to theft. of the !mat, anc guickGl pus!, him overboard attempted to swim backto w and begged us to take him back, saying he woad go =jukere with us. I dant trust him so I tookone of Jug., and pointed it at him I told him to leave us done and swim backto the shore if he wanted to live. 
Chapter 6 
After seeing the man swim away, I turned to the boy and asked him to stator that he woad be faithful ta me. He did as I asked. In the meantime, I steered the boat toward the con.entpnuenthrg we were heading that. I wanted to persuade the man swimming away that we were going in that direction when in fact I had soma., else M mind After I fast sight of h. I turned the boat toured the barbarian ca... was dangerous because the nat., could at.kus, but at feast the pirates wouldn't thinkofthilowing vs them After it grew dark, I changed direction and tried to keep close to the shore. 'The wand was good and I believed by the afternoon of the next day we were fang gone from the rand of the pirates. Stiff, 1 was so al.aid of being captured by them again that I iln't  stop the boat 

or go ashore for fwe more days. On ttc sixth day the wind changed l thought that even if they were following us, this must have made them cfuorge their minds; so J let the boats° close to the shore, and we anchored in the mouth of a &de river. didn't know where we were. All we wanted ems sant e fresh water. We waited tiff it was complete§ dadc, hoping to swim ashore unseen and get water, but as soon as night fell we started hearing horrible erie.sfrom the shore. '7. boy begged me not to go ashore. We remained on the boat, but we couldn't sleep because some two or three hours Cater some matures came to wash themselves in the water; making horrific noises I had never heard before. The .boy was extreme§frightened, and, was We were even more terrified when we heard one of the creatures swimming toward.. The bay begged me to sail away, but I feared the creatures might follow us. Instead I tookone of the,uns an d shot at the beast, which made him turn around* and go backer, the shore ?fearing the gun fire, off the other mottoes started crying and shouting shouting so hideously that I was convinced they had never hean f a gun before.. abandoned all hope of getting water bring the night and stayed on the boat until t. morning. 
Chapter 7 
As soon as it ants f§ht again, the boy offered toga ashore but I decided it .rsdi be safer if we both went.. had some bread for breakfast. Then, carrying only =rpm and two jars for the water, we made for the beach. Once. were on shore a darn., want to lose sight of the boat, so the boy went elm a bit farther infant toga some fresh water. I saw him running on his mew, and thought some of the creatures were chasing him. I was wrong. . was fun-Tying to show. he had killed  an animal that looked ake a rabbit.. were both my glad bemuse the meat wasgomf and we had found fresh water. Most of all, we .regfruf we had neither run into the scary creatures nor seen any human footprints. knew . must have been dose to the Car, 75.4 and the Cape Venfe Islands, but I had no instruments for navigation which could help me locate them. vac (toping we would meet an English ship by moving along the coast. I was guessaw we were in a land where no people Geer because we rful not see any people by day and only heanf wild beasts roaring by night. One morning when we were e going to get water, the boy showed me aguat beast steeping in the shade near us. It was an enormous fnis The boy was too afraid toga shoat it, so I fowled three gwts and aimed at the steeping animal. The first buffet .t krs feg, and the lion woke up andgave the most terrible roar I have ever head in my fift. The second buffet hit him in the head a n left him strwjg fin gfor life. At this point the boy jumped ashore, went to the Gm, and "ft...of him with one fast shot in the .ad cut off one orf the lion's paws and brought it to the boat as a tmphy. Atthough we couldn't eat the meat, I wanted LIMA,. cOhe beast, as it was very big. We, it on top of the boat, andsoon it was by.

, the next tenor twelve days we sailed close to the shore, stopping only toft h` our jars with clean water. Soon . started to notice that the land was inhabited Several times we saw naked bfackpeople on the beach watching us. wanted to stop .1 go to therm but the boy begged me not to do it. Nevertheless, I :awed to than and saw them run toward the boat without any weapons. The boy warned rte that cart of the men had a long stick, l tried to sign w the people that we needed food They signed to Me a come ashore, showing they woufellning us some food I slowed the Boat, and two of them ran into the forest soon to return with some dry meat .6 gmitt We didn't want approach the land, and they were too afraid to swim to us, so we ca., know how to reach the food: Seeing this, they stepped backand were soon quite farfmm the food Nk approathed and tookit onboard . signuf to thankthem but had nothing to g. in return for the food. At that very moment two animals tame running from the mountains, chasing each °Meng.. people on the beach were eery afraid but the animals attackthem. The two creatures went into the water, and one of them came very close to our boat. shot at it. That made the creature swim backto the breath, but it died just before reaching it. The people on the beach were amared to hear the gun fire, and some of themfainted with fear. I made signs to them to come backto ,fie beach and het, f them bring the animal to the shore with a ape. It tut..d out to be a very strange Impart:1.5u other creature must have been frightened by t.gun, beast it had run away backto the mountains. The peopk on the beach wan. the Ash of the animal, and we took.t. skin. 'They wets so put/it I that I had saved' duns from the kopard that they brought me even mar efood and water. We had so much food and water on the boat that we dal not need to stop for some ten days.. the seventh day we saw a long piece of land extending very far into the sea and there wen islands within sight. I assumed those were the Ca, Verdelsfmufs. I had just stepped ...side the caboh to consider whether we should go to the islands when the boy came running to me.. was screaming because he had seen a ship with a sail 
Cha,er 9 
The boy was really scared because he thought the ship belonged to the pirate from whom . had escaped. As soot m Haw the ship, f knew it was Portuguese. It ro s going in another direction and; although we were sailing toward it a sfast tu we could there was small 

chance the people on the ship would notice us. „hut as we waz beginnittg to despair, the ship changed i t s direction and turnedour way. I fired' agtm to, their attention, and they noticed' us.

One moming three planters, who just C14 me needed more workers, tante tome and asked me tojoin them on a secret journey to Guinea. lf the a,pedition was successful, I would re.ceive some new slava. It was a fair proposition, and I started arranging the necessary documents. I made a forma! will; leaving all my belonging., in case I did not return, to my friend; the captain.

I found some an after drinking, !chewed some tobacco instead of eating dinner. ?hen I made myself a dub from a short stickbecause I was afraid, might be attacked by an animal: I decided to spend the night, in a tree.

Since the ship was unmoving, I started considering haw to reach it so I coal retrieve all the useful objets that were stiff thus. When I came dorm from the tree, I saw that the small boat was on the beach but quite far from me. I started walking toward f it but there um deep water between me and that side y 'the beach, so I could not reach the boat. I decided- not to mute any more time but to try to get to theship first. 
Chapter 13 
Soon after noon the tide was low and could watketoser to the ship. I noticed that it was stage and not damaged much which made MC thinktfurt if we had stayed on it, we might a I has survived the storm. It made me cry to thinkthat this would have saved my friends. Instead, now I was all atone. When I calmed down I tookoff my clothes and swam to the ship. I dui not see any, to, inside the big ship so I swam around it twice. 'Me second. time I spotted a rope hanging on one side. I used it to climb up and one on board I began to search for food and toots could me. I was shy lucky because I found all the food on the ship was dry. I went into the .cfren and fitkd my pockets with biscuits. I was eating them tohite exploring the other cabin., I afro found a bottle of rum which I tookwith me. 'Aar was no other boat on the ship and needed one to carry the food and tools to the shore. That is why I tooksome boards and made a raft. I dise.raered three big wooden thests and put them on my raft. ?ft efirst one I emptied of off contents an dfiffe d with the bread, rice, cheese, meat and corn I heal found. I came across some more bottles of alcohol which I also put on the mft.Ihen I noticed that the tide was getting high again and the clothes which I had left on the beach were already floating away. r was stiff on the ship so I Cooked for more clothes. 'What I needed the mast was tools and so when I found the carpenter's chest I was eetretnely happy. Nekt I tooted for arms which l needed to protect myself and to hunt. I found 4 gum, 2 swords and 3 barrels of powder two of which were dry. Having loaded all this on my raft I started thinking how to get backto the shore. just before I left the ship I found two saws, an ate, a hammer and two broken oars from the boat. I tooktfsern and used them to navigate the raft. ?he sea was smooth., the tide was rising and the wind was blowing tow°. the rand MI this would natuniffy lead me to the shore, yet I noticed my raft wasn't going straight back This made me thinkthere was a dm- nearby and if so, I could use it m a port. Soon I fours the river and guided my raft in the middle f it. I did not know the coast so my mftgot stuckEverytking on it .pped to the edge and hilmast lost it. I had to fiord up the chests with elf m y strength for half an hour before the tide sou high enough to set the ate  !loafing agate. 1 went further into the niter but I could not find a Mace to /and because the shore was very steep. I decided to wait for the tide to Aft me up again. ft wasn't long before I managed' to step on the beach. I propped the oars on the duo sides of the raft to keep it stiff and went to fookfor a place where I cm& stay. 
Chapter 14 
I was now capturing this part of the heath, looking fora hiding place for my belongings. I saw a steep hill nearby and taking ague and some powder, I started walking towards it. Once on top, I saw that I was on an island. 'There were some 10C.s in the distance and two smaffer islands nearby. I couldn't see any sign of people on my island, only wild beasts. On the way fuck, the raft I saw many birth I didn't recognize. l.fedone but I dad not even know whether I toad eat it. It tamed out the meat wasn't good I went backto the raft and spent the rest of the day dragging the chests and my other &scour,. sfarther into the Land I had to make, myself a safe place for the night because f was afraid c being attacked by animals at night. I made a kind of a hut from the chests cud the boards of the raft. working I was thinking that I hove to go backw the ship again. I had to get everything useful which was an it because the firm storm might break. into pieces. 'e nett day I left my clothes in the but and swam back to the  ship. On board I made a second raft, which I then Waded with many valuable things. I found a couple of bags with nails, as wet, other tools. There were Isis° 7guns, bullets for then, and some mate powder. I remembered to take elf the clothes I couldfind. 'There was also a hanunockand some beds which I thought might come in handy forme. I brought aff this safely on shore and what I returned to the smal hut I saw that my belongings were untouched.

I cut branches from the same tree which I used for both my fences. After drying these bnmthes, I used them to mate b.kas. 'When I finished that, I decided to take another,  longer trip around the island. This time I could take more food with me, now that I had the bask.s.

In May the following year I sew) than again and it was ago o d occasion to .tavene anti fight them. :Meanwhile something else happened that disturbed, routine. One evati, I was startled out of my orduu, activities by the sound of a gunsiwt at sea. I foul just got out of my house when saw a flash coming fiont the sea. second:gunshot followed It crossed , mind that this nutst all be amt., fiom some ship . danger aski, for help. I gathered all the dry wood I coukifituf arowd and ran to the beach where I made a big ftre. The y saw me an d fired again. I kept the ftre tmed the monsing but there was no sn of them. As the day fa*, I saw something far away at sea. thought they nwst have anthoraf there but when I looked again from the top cy. a hill I saw that there were only wrecks left cf the ship.

'The ship seemed Spwtish by construction, but was completely destroy,. When I went cfoser, a dog appear, on the deck., fed it bread and water because it was starved and e„,tremely thirsty. I foutul only two dead men on the ship, but dare was so sign c anyone else. 
There were several chests and big casks of some akohof, but the tatter were too heavy to move. Wi. I searched a., I faund another, smeller cask of liquor which in.agett to puff to my boat. I ohofo.d guns an d gunpowder: I left the weapons because I had plenty of them, but I tookthe powder and some other useful* things 1 found 'on kr., In the evening I returned to the island and spent the night in the boat. The neat morning I decided to Ming aft I had found to my cave instead ef taking it to the fortification. Once they were there, I opened the chats and found more liquor. them. Thar was afro meat, some shirts and handkerrhieft, as well as Bahl and other treasures. in the last chest I found some.,fine gunpowder which was ofgroat value to me. On the island, it was much more vat.. than any money w pre,us nuteds.q.re was something else whiz h I needed just as badly as powder and that was shoes. l had tafart the shoes off the feet of the two dammed men on board t. ship and I found two more pairs M one of the chests.

After I hasten, di my new possessions in the cave, I hid the bow gain and went backto my fortification. I retumed to my previous life, only I was mare vigilant and attentive than before. gime was passing and I was eften thinking about the people I had seen on the beach. I was wondering whether I had any clumce of survi, if I went to sea with my boat. These thoughts were always M the baekof my mind, day and night. It was one night in March when I dream, that 2 canoes with savages had hulled on the beach. One of their victims ran away and came torsion& my fortification where I saved him muthe knelt to me and became my.savant. helped me navigate out of the dangerous currents around the island 
I woke up, but this was all stuck. :try mind. I realised that if I had a swage to help me I night be able to escape from the island and roach the continent. Perhaps I could save one of the victims brought to this Leland to be eaten. I made iqs my .suf to lookout for the savages mu ffro- the nett year mil a half I woad, daily wen, the beach, hoping to see canoes. This finally happened one morning. I was in my fortification when I saw 5 canoes with more than thirty men on the shore. I coutd not attack them sir, they were too many, so I just waited observing them through my uleseope They had a fire set up and were darting IM7U7Uf it. I also saw two men, probably victims, tied together. After a while the two ti, men were brought to the fire. One was beaten with a club and the other was left standing.

Friday's father and the Spaniard could not go over the frnce or climb a Gunder and I did not want to destroy the fence. W e made a comfortabte tent for them outside the fortification and prepared beds and blankets funn branches. As soon as we finished' this, I set about cooking dinner. Friday kiffe d a yowl g goat cu f we boiler, soup out of its meat- It was delicious and ue all had dinner together in the tent. Friday was my interpreter, because the Spartianf spoke the ta,age cj the scrooges as well. After that I asked Friday logo backto the beach and bring us the weapons we had lefi in our hurry to help the prisoners. I atm asked 

him to bury the bodies o f the killed cannibals the next day.. obeyed* my orders, so later when I went to the beach code f handy recognize the place if it wasn't for the big tree behind which we had lay hidden. The next morning I asked Friday's father what he thought of the savages returning to get their revenge on us. He sa d he believed they could' not have survived the storm, but if they did, the nearest wag was the island of their opponents, so they would not have landed there either. 
In his opinion, even if by some happy char. they had reached their island, they had been astonished to see our guns and would not know how we won the battle using therm., ueuld most probady tett their nation that their friends hed been kilted by tfunufer (Oozing. He said he hard them cry out in their language that Friday and I were sinrits sent fonn heaven to punish them with ftre.

I was still aztxious the savages might return with a bigger army, but nothing of the kin c t 'happened, so after awn,. kna n considering the voyage by sea again. I asked the Spaniard about his arriv a on the-se isfasuCs and he sad that he had been on a Spanish ship going to Havana. There were sixteen more Eunmeans, 5,tiOlIS n Portuguese, on Friday's home island. He told me that fwe Portuguese sadors were savedfrom another shipwreckand taken aband 'The storm broke the ship near my island and some of the men dimmed The re.st saved themselves in a boat and nese now living with the sovages. askee the Spanianf whether they had not tried to wderta4 another sea voyage, but he sad that they had no tools with which to build another boat. .They did not even have gunpowder because it a II spoiled in the water. I asked his opinion on the current situatitm. Even I and theSpanish and Portuguese sailors somehow managed. to reach the continent, I woud be in danger of being carried inw the Inquisition.. assured me that they had so miserably amcmg the savages that they would never consider betraying me to their officials. The „Spanish an I Portuguese sailors &rine clothes left, na food or weapons, so that returning to tfzeir fellowmen was completety out ej question. He was convinced that they would do anything to go home an d would trutt me very wed* my help. Hearing aff this and guerving the Spaniard for some time, decided that it would be better if he a n Friday's father return to their island and inform the otherEuropeans of our plan. After that, they would bring them ad here, where with my toots an d knowlie* and with their help we codd build a vessel to carry as to the continent. it was then that the Spanianf stiggeste d something else.. persuaded me that it would be better to delay the execution ti this pfmt for at feast ha( I a year, because there was not enough foodforfifteen more men on my island . would not furve enough food to eat while budding the ship, and much less tO take,. us for the long voyage.

'Eight lays had pawl since they [eft when something uneipeeted happened. 

One morning Friday roc* me up to teff me they had returned. I was so united an. in my hurry 1forgot to take any weapons with me. From the top of the nearest fall I saw a boat with a sail on the horizon, but coming fnmi a completely different direction. It immediately occurred to me that these were not the people we were eqecting. I returned to thefortifwation and took, telescope. With its fidp I discorxred an anchored ship dose to the shore. By its construction, the ship seetnedEngfish and so did the boat. I v.; confused On one fumd I was happy to find fellow Englishmen after twenty-seven years on the ishauf. On the other hand 1 was concerned because the island was quite out of the way of any English ship. Recently there had beat no storms which could ham taken them here. Beth, they wax pirates or murderers and I were. hiding here? Alf this made me very cautious. Friday and I remained hill, observing than for a while. the boat approathed the beach and I counted eleven men some of whirl 1 had taken to be Tag., some 'Dutch. lt wasn't long before I realized duo, in fact, they were aff Englishmen. qhree of the men war unarmed and bound and as soon as the boat mocha the sand, fire of the others tookthem to the beach. Two of the prisoners acre calm and composed, but the third one was mak,. g passionate gestures.. seemed desperate and was begging the ones in the boat for something. On seeing this, Friday turned to me and pointed out that it seemed Englishmen were also eating fellow men.
