Chapter 1 
i was born in York, England in 1632. My father was German and my mother was English. My father, family name was Kreutznaer, but after he came to England people started calling him Crusoe. My mother, family was called Robinson. This is how I came to be .led Robinson Crusoe. I had two elder brothers. The oldest one joined the army and was killed in battle. The middle one disappeared and we never heard what became of him. I was well-educated and my father wanted me to study law, but I wanted to go to sea. Nothing would convince me to .y at home and become a lawyer. I was 18 years old when one day my father called me to his room. He was old and suffered from a disease which kept him in bed. My father asked me why I wanted to go to sea when I can .y at home, study and prosper in my own country. He told me that travelling abroad by sea was dangerous. He warned me that I would lose peace and comfort of my home if I go to sea. My father also told me that if I go abroad my fate might be similar to that of my eldest brother. When saying this he started crying and he could not continue. My father, advice and wamthg,s made me thi. and I started to forget my desire to travel by sea. Yet, my decision to stay home did not last long. One week passed and I made my mind up to talk to my mother and tell her I am determined to travel. I told her how curious i was. 1 told her how I wanted to see the world, then asked her to speak to my father. I asked her to convince him to let me go on one sea journey. I promised that if I did not like it I would go hack home and start working very hard. My mother did not agree. She also did not want me to go abroad. I stayed home one mom year. The whole time I was thinking whether to follow my parents' wish or my own desire. One day 1 was to the town of Han. A friend of mine was going with his father, ship to London and he invited me to go with him for free. I wasn't prepared and my parents did not know, but I boarded that ship on that September day. T. is how my unhappy adventures began. 
Chapter 2 
The moment the ship left the river and went into the sea my troubles started. There was strong wind and the sea was rough. A storm was approaching. I was very frightened and felt seasick. I began to regret my decision to leave home. I thought every wave was going to .k the ship. T promised myself I would go home and apologize to my parents as soon an I stepped on dry land again. The storm was over by the morning. I was still seasick during the day and I was ththlang about the tenible storm. The evening, however, was very beautiful and the sea was very peaceful I thought that was the most wonder. sight I had ever seen. That night I slept well and T was no longer seasick. One of the sailors came to me and we started talking. He asked me what I thought of the light wind last night I told him I was very scared of the storm and he offered me a drink called punch. T got drunk and forgot how scared I had been. I also forgot my decision to go back home. Instead I was dreaming about more travels by sea. The next few days the wind was blowing against us and we couldn't move much. A week later the wind increased and we decided to ant off. The very next day them was a great storm. I was terrified and this time I could see that the other sailors were also very scared. The captain was walking in and out of his cabin. He was quietly saying prayers. 1 was so scared I couldn't do anything else but lie in my bed and hope we would survive. When i heard the captain talk to himself I got up and looked out the window of my cabin. The waves were as tall as mountains. I saw other ships which looked like toys. The waves were moving them around violently. Our sailors tried out that a ship had sunk in front of us. I was terribly afraid and regretted that I hadn't gone home after the first light storm. The storm was getting worse and now all the sailors were praying we would survive. Suddenly someone shouted that there was a leak to the .p and water was coming tin. Everyone was called down to pump the water out. I was paralyzed with fear, and I couldn't get out of my bed. Then the men came and told me to go down and help, so T went. I was pumping out the water when the captain ordered someone to shoot a fire gun. It was a signal that we were in danger. I thought we were sinking, because the ship was broken. !thought we were all going to drown. I fainted with fear. It was only hours later that I regained my senses. 
Chapter 3 
We were all working very hard but the water kept comthg ano the ship. The storm was not as dangerous anymore but the .p was already badly damaged. Our captain continued fiang guns for help. There was a small ship in front of us which sent us a boat The sailors on that boat risked their lives but managed to reach our ship. With great di Ifi.ty we all boarded the boat. We couldn't dank of going back to their .p which was very far way already. It was too dangerous, so we decided to try to get to shore instead. Fifteen minutes later our .p sank. We were safe on the boat, but I was .1 so afraid 1 couldn't watch. We were soon close to the land and we could see many people on the beach expecting us. When we finally reached the land we were treated with great kindness. The local people helped us find rooms and gave us money to get to London or go back to Hull. lexiXelhay clivaonnYi edenasbe■Otinwn:=417en'cr, home then. OTfettng‘Zr sunk, my father "gNa'cl171eron:na and 

never go to sea again. I met him and his father in town. The owner of the ship turned to me and told me I should take this disaster as a sign to go home. Despite all this, I was very stubborn and decided to go to London. 
Chapter 4 
travelled to London by land. The whole way I was wondering what to do and where to go. I was too ashamed of myself to go back home. In London I met die captain of another ship who had already been to the coast of Guinea before. He offered me to travel with him and be his companion for the journey. As I still had some money, I chose to travel as a passenger and not as a sailor_ The captain of the ship also promised me that he would carry back to England any treasure I might make in Africa. When leaving London, he advised me what to buy for trade in Africa. At the time I only had E40 which I managed to get with the assistance of my relatives. This journey was my only successful one because I return. to England with some gold dust which was worth almost E300. The journey was also good for me because the captain taught me a bit about mathematics and navigation. I teamed what was necessary in order to become a sailor and a merchant_ 5.1, this trip wasn't perfect_ I was constantly sick and had fever. Soon after we came back to England my friend, the captain, died. I decided to make the same journey.. the same ship back to Guinea. I left E200 with the widow of my friend . I had only E100 to trade in Africa. This was one of the unhappiest journeys a man has ever taken. The fits[ disaster happened when we were between the Canary Islands and the African shore. Early one morning a Turkish ship started chasing us. This continued the whole day and about three in the afternoon the pirates came very close. We had twelve guns and the pirates eighteen. There was an attack, but we managed to drive them away. On the second attempt, sixty of their men came on the ship and started destroying everything. We managed to push them off board twice, but they kept returning. Some of our sailors were killed and some were badly injured, . we had to surrender. All of us were taken prisoner. 
Chapter 5 
Most of my fellow men were cartied to the emperor's court, but because I was young and strong I remained as a slave to the captain of the pirates. I felt very sad, but this was only the beginning of my troubles. I was hoping my new master would take me with him when he went to sea; and when a Spanish or a Portuguese captain attacked him, T would be set free. Yet this did not happen because my master left me to look after his garden every time he went to sea. I spent two years hoping to escape. Sometimes when my master went fishing he would take me and another young man to help him. Sometimes he would even send me and the you, man with one of his relatives fishing in a small boat. One morning when we were fishing, a thick fog rose and we were lost. We struggled to reach the shore the whole day and the following nigh, but it was only the next morning that we finally got back. After this adventure, my master decided to use a bigger boa, the one from our English ship, and make it more comfortable. He had a cabin built in the middle of it and installed some additional sailing equiprnent. One day my master ordered me to put extra food and drinks as well as guns with powder on the boat as he was expecting some .tinguish. guests to join him for fishing. They also intended to do some hunting after... However, the guests refused the offer at the 1ast moment, and my master let his relative, myself, and the boy go fishing as usual. When my master told me this, I remembered all my plans for escape and prepared the boat not for fishing but for a journey. I convinced the captain's relative to bring more food, pretending that we shouldn't eat our master, food. I secretly brought some more bottles and additional gear such as a rope, a hammer, and a big lump of beeswax making candles. I also asked the captain's relative for powder and bullets, again lying that we needed them to shoot birds for my master's table. Soon we were at sea, and I pretend. I couldn't catch any fish. This way I persuaded the others to go farther out to s.. The captain, relative went to the front of the boat, and I quickly pushed him overboard. He attempt. to swim hack to us and begged us to take him back, saying he would go anywhere with us. I didn't trust h.. I took one of the guns and pointed it at him. f told him to leave us alone and swim back to the shore if he wan. to live. 
Chapter 6 
After seeing the man swim away, I turned to the boy and asked him to swear that he would be faithful to me. He did as I asked. In the meantime. I steered the boat toward the continent pretending we were heading there. I wanted to persuade the man swimming away that we were going in that dire.on when in fact I had something else in .ncL After I lost sight of him, I tuned the boat toward the barbarian coast. This was dangerous because the natives could attack us, but at least the pirates wouldn't think of following us there. After it grew dark, I changed direction and tried to keep close to the shore. The wind was good, and I believed by the afternoon of the next day we were long gone from the land of the pirates. S., I was so afraid of being captured by them again that I didn't stop the boat or go ashore for five more days. On the sixth day the wind changed. I thought that even if they were following us, this must have made them change their minds; so I let the boat go close to the shore, and 

we anchored in the mouth of a little river. I didn't know where we were. All we wanted was some fresh water. We waited till it was completely dark, hoping to swim ashore unseen and get water, but as soon as night fell we started hearing horrible cries from the shore. The boy begged me not to go ashore. We remained on the boat, but we couldn't sleep because some two or three hours later some creatures came to wash themselves in the water, making horrific noises I had never heard before. The boy was extremely frightened, and so was I. We were even more terrified when we heard one of the creatures swimming toward us. The boy begged me to sail a., but I feared the creatures might follow us. Instead, I took one of the guns and shot at the beast, which made him turn around and go back to the shore. Hearing the gun fire, all the other creatures started crying and shouting so hideously that I was convinced they had never heard a gun before. We abandoned all hope of getting water during the night and stayed on the boat until the morning. 
Chapter 7 
As soon as it was light again, the boy offered to go ashore but I decided it would be safer if we both went. We had some bread for breakfast. Then, carrying only our guns and two jars for the water. we made for the beach. Once we were on shore, I didn't want to lose sight of the boat, so the boy went alone a bit farther inland to get some fresh water. I saw him running on his return. and f thought some of the creatures were chasing him. I was wrong. He was hurrying to show me he had killed an animal that looked like a rabbit. We were both very glad because the meat was good and we had found fresh water. M. of all, we were glad we had neither run into the scary creanues nor seen any human footprints. I ;mew we must have been close to the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde Islands, but I had no insuuments for navigation which could help me locate them. I was hoping we would meet an English ship by moving along the coast. I was guessing we were in a land where no people lived because we thd not see any people by day and only heard wild beasts roaring by night. One morning when we were going to get water, the boy showed me a great beast sleeping M the shade near us. It was an enormous lion. The boy was too afraid to go shoot so I loaded three guns and aimed at the sleeping animal. The first bullet hit his leg, and the lion woke up and gave the most terrible roar I have ever heard in my life. The second bullet hit him M the head and left him struggling for life. At this point the boy jumped ashore, went to the lion, and finished him with one last shot M the head. He cut off one of the lion's paws and brought it to the boat as a trophy. Although we couldn't cat the meat, I wanted the skin of the beast, as it was very big. We pm it on top of the boa, and soon it was dry. 
Chapter 8 
For the next ten or twelve days we sailed dace to the shore, stopping only to fill our jars with dean wattr. Soon we started to notice that the land was inhabited. Several dmes we saw naked blade people on the beach watching us. I wanted to stop and go to them, but the boy begged me not to do it. Nevenheless, I waved to them and saw them run toward the boat without any weapons. The boy warned me that one of the men had a long stick. I tried to sign to the people that we needed food. They signed to me to come ashore, showing they would bring us some food. I slowed the boa, and two of them ran into the forest soon to return with some dry meat and grain. We didn't want approach the land, and they were too afraid to swim to ., so we didn't know how to reach the food. Seeing this, they stepped back and were soon quite far from the food. We approached and took it mthoard. We signed to thank them but had nothing to give M return for the food. At that very moment two animals came running from the mountains, chasing each other. The people on the beach were very afraid, but the animals didn't attack them. The two creatures went into the water, and one of them came very close to our boa. I shot at it. That made the creature .m back to the beach, but it thed just before reaching it. The people on the beach were amazed CO hear the , fire, and some of them Minted with fear. T made signs to them to come back to the beach and helped them bring the animal to the shore with a rope. it turned out to be a very strange leopard. The other creature must have been frightened by the ,, because it had run away back to the mountains. The people on the beach waned the flesh of the animal, and we took the skin. They were so grateful that I had saved them from the leopard that they brought me even more food and water. We had so much food and water on the boat that we did not need to stop for some . days. On the eleventh day we saw a long piece of land extending very far into the sea, and there were islands within sight. I assurned those were the Cape Verde Islands. I had just stepped inside the cabin to consider whether we should go to the islands when the boy came running to me. He was screaming because he had seen a ship with a sail. 
Chapter 9 
The boy was really scared because he thought the ship belonged to the pirate from whom we had escaped. As soon as I saw the ship, I knew it was Portuguese. It was going M another direction and, although we were sailing toward it as fast as we could, there was small chance the people on the ship would notice us. Just as we were begMthng to despair, the ship changed is direction and turned our way. I fired a gun to get their attention, and they noticed us. Three hours later we were alongside the Portuguese ship. They asked me in Portuguese, Spanish, and French who I was, but I couldn't understand. There was a Scottish sailor who approached me, and I told 

him my story. On hearing this, all the sailors began to treat to very kindly. They took me and the boy and all our belongings on board_ We were bthh extremely glad to he rescued, and we offered all our goods to the captain of the ship; but he kindly refused to accept them. The captain offered to buy our boat and to take the boy as a servant I didn't want to sell the boy's liberty, especially since he had served me SO well, but the captain said he would treat him fairly and set h. free M ten years' time if he turned Christian. The boy wanted to go with the captain, so I agreed. The ship was going to Brazil where we arrived twenty-two days later. The .ptain was very generous and bought almost all my belongings, including the skins of the leopard and the lion. M this way I had some money that I could use to trade. He even recommended me to a friend of his who had a sugar plantation. I liked Brazil and bought some land for myself. For the next two years I produced just enough to .t, but in the third year I finally planted some cane for trade. On one of his next travels back to England, the captain brought me some of the money I had left there. My plantation was growing and developing. and I was soon living very prosperously. After four years of living in Brazil I had leamed the language and made friends among the other planters and merchants. I would often mA to them and tell them about the slave trade in Guinea. 
Chapter 10 
One momthg three planters, who just like me needed more workers, came to me and asked me to join them on a secret journey to Guinea. If the expedition was successful, I would receive some new slaves. It was a fair proposition, and I started arranging the necessary documents_ f made a formal will, leaving all my belongings, M case I did not return, to my frimd, the captain. Looking back at it now, I re, returning to sea so rashly and leaving my comfortable life in Brazil. f went on board on the same date, the of September that I had left my parents' house in Hull eight years earlier. Our ship was very big, but carried only 17 men and six guns. It was loaded with goods for trade such as glass beads, mirrors, knives,. scissors, and similar things. At the beginning of our journey the weather was very good, but very hot In two weeks' time a hurricane came upon us and was threatening our ship for the next twelve days. One man died of fever, and during the storm two men were washed overboard. After the hurricane passed, we saw that we had gone quite far from our original route and were instead close to the northern pan of Brazil near the Orinoco River. The ship was so badly damaged that we could no longer go to Africa. The captain wanted us to go back and repair the ship, but i strongly disagreed with h.. He and I went over the maps and decided that the best thing to do was to go E0 Barbados and repair the ship there. When we set out on this short trip, a second storm came upon us and drove us far out to sea. The next morning one of the sailors cried OM, "Lands and that very moment the ship ran aground in shallow water. We expected the ship to break apart at any moment bemuse of the strong wind, so we all got into the small boat the ship carried. This was very dangerous because the eleven of us still alive crowded the boat, and it had no sail. We knew that we would crash into the shore because the wind was still very strong. 
Chapter 11 
We didn't know what the shore was like or whether we could land on it Suddenly, an enormous wave appeared and overturned the boat 1 was covered with water and couldn't breathe. I couldn't see the others or the boat Another wave carried me to the beach. I was half-dead with all the water I had taken in. L could hardly move, but i knew had to go farther onto the land to prevent another wave from carrying me bath into the sea. Before I mend get to my feet another wave crashed upon me, and I was washed into the water.' couldn't breathe for some time, but then the next wave threw me back onto the beach_ As soon as I recovered, I got up and started running farther inland. Two mom waves lifted me after that. The last one nearly killed me because I was thrown furiously against a cliff. The blow left me senseless. When I woke up, I decided to hold on to the rock until the storm went away. After a while I was able to climb on top of the high rock and sit down. There was no danger for me up there. I was saved. 
Chapter 12 
High on the rock I was safe and extremely happy that I had survived, but i was also thinking about my friends. I never mw any of them again. All I found on the beach afterward were three hats, a .p, and two shoes that didn't match. The storm was still raging, but the waves weren't as big anymore, and I could see the ship. It was so far from the land that I couldn't stop wondering how on earth i had managed to reach the rocky shore alive. I looked around and noticed i had almost nothing. T was wet and had no other clothes. I had nothing to .t or think and nothing with whit[ to defend myself if an animal attacked me. All I found M my pocicets was a knife, a pipe, and a litde box with tObaCCO. I was terrified. How could I possibly survive with only these three things? What if some beast found me during the approaching night? I moved from the rock to the land behind it and from there I went to the beach. Before sunset I explored the shore while looking for some fresh water. i found some and after drinking, I chewed some tobacco instead of eating dinner. Then I 

made myself a dub from a short stick because I was afraid I might be attacked by an animal. I decided to spend the night up in a tree. 1 picked a thick tree with thorns and climbed up to the top where I was going to sit up all night, but I was so tired that I fell asleep and woke up only the next morning. The sea was calm now. I was surprised to discover that the waves have moved the ship, and it was now very dose to the rock where I had almost died last night Since the ship was unmoving, I starred considering how to reach it so 1 could retrieve all the useful objects that were still there. When T came down from the tree, I saw that the small boat was on the beach but quite far from me. I started walking toward it but there was deep water between me and that side of the beach, so I could ncx reach the how. I decided not to waste any more time but to try to get to the ship rust 
Chapter 13 
Soon after noon the tide was low and I could walk closer to the ship. I noticed that it was stable and not damaged much which made me think that if we had stayed on it, we might all have survived the storm. It made me cry to think that this would have saved my friends. Instead, now I was all alone. When I calmed down I took off my clothes and swam to the ship. I did not .e any way to get inside the big ship so I swam around it twice. The second time I sported a rope hanging on one side. I used it to climb up and once on board I began to search for food and tools I could use I was very ludcy became I found all the food on the ship was dry. I went into the kitchen and filled my pockets with biscuits. I was eating them while exploring the other cabin, I also found a bottle of rum which I took with me. There was no other boat on the ship and I needed one to carry the food and tools to the shore. That is why I took some hoards and made a raft. I discovered three big wooden chests and put them on my raft. The fuss one I emptied of all contents and filled with the bread, rice, daerse, meat and corn I had found. I .me across some more bottles of alcohol which T also put on the raft. Then I noticed that the tide was getting high again and the clothes which I had left on the beach were already floating away. I was still on the ship so I looked for more clothes. What I needed the most was tools and so when I found the carpenter's ch. I was extremely happy. Next I looked for arms which I needed to protect myself and to hun, found 4 guns, 2 swords and 3 barrels of powder two of which were dry. Having loaded all this on my raft I started thinking how to get back to the shore. J. before I left the ship I found two saws, an axe, a hammer and two bro.') oars from the boa, took them and us. them to navigate the raft. The sea was smooth, the tide was rising and the wind was blowing towards the land. All this would naturally lead me to the shore, yeti noticed my raft wasn't going straight back. This made me think there was a river nearby and if so, 1 could use it as a port. Soon I found the river and guided my raft in the middle of it. I did not know the coast so my raft got stuck. Everything on it slipped to the edge and I almost lost it. I had to hold up the chests with all my strength for half an hour before the tide was high enough to set the raft floating again. I went further into the river but I could not find a place to land because the shore was very steep. I decided to wait for the tide to lift me up again. it wasn't long before I managed to step on the beach. T propped the oars on the two sides of the raft to keep it .11 and went to look for a place where I could stay. 
Chapter 14 
was now exploring this part of the beach, looking for a hiding place for my belongings. I saw a steep hill nearby and taking a gun and some powder, I started walking towards it. Once on top, I saw that I was on an island. There were some rocks in the distance and two smaller islands nearby. I couldn't sec any sign of people on my island, only wild beasts. On the way hack to the raft i saw many birds I didn't recognize. I killed one but I .d not even know whether could eat it. It turned out the meat wasn't good. I went back to the raft and spent the rest of the day dragging the chests and my other discoveries farther into the land. I had to make myself a safe place for the night because was afraid of being attacked by a.mals at night. I made a kind of a but from the chests and the boards of the raft. While working I was thinking that I have to go back to the ship again. had toga everything useful which was on it because the first storm might break it into pieces. The next day I left my clothes in the but and swam back to the ship. On board I made a second raft, which I then loaded with many valuable things. I found a couple of bags with nail, as well as other tools. There were .o 7 gun, bullets for them, and some more powder. I remember.' to take all the clothes I could find. There was also a hammock and some beds which I thought might come in handy for me. 1 brought all this safely on shore and when I returned to the small but I saw that all my belongings were untouched. There was only a wild cat sitting on top of one of the chests but it ran away when I approached I threw the cat a small piece of biscuit The cat ate it and stayed around expecting some more but i could not spare anymore so eventually it went away it was getting late, so I made a small tent and brought everything that could be spoiled by rain or sunshine in it. Then I arranged the empty thesis around it in a circle. I hoped this would protect it from an unexpected attack. After that I went inside and blocked the door with boards from the raft I spread one of the beds on the ground, placed three guns next to my head and, exhausted from all the work T had done, I fell asleep almost immediately. 

Chapter 15 
From then on I would go to the ship every day... way I brought many useful tools and objects. The third time went T brought as many of the ropes and sails as I could cant'. Some days after I made another happy discovery on board the ship when I found more bread, nut, sugar and some fine flour. All of this I brought back with me to the little fortification on the beach. When T went to the ship the next thy I started cutting cables. I made another raft and loaded it with pieces of iron and cables but it overturned just when I was reaching the land_ I lost the iron parts but managed CO recover some of the cables when the tide was low again. I have now been on that island for thirteen days and I have gone to the ship eleven times. The twelfth time 1 discovered a drawer full of razors, scissors, knives and forks. There were also some coins from Europe and Brazil there. I knew the money was worthless now, but .11 I took it. Meanwhile the sky was getting dark, clouds were gathering and the wind was getting stronger. I knew it was no use making a raft when a storm was approaching so I swam back to the shore. That night the wind was blowing fiercely but I was safe inside my little tent. The next morning the ship was gone. 
Chapter 16 
knew I had to make myself a better fortification where I would be more comfortable, but more importantly, I would be safe. I considered looking for a cave or making a bigger tent but in the end I decided to do both. I needed a place which was close to fresh water, which was sheltered from the heat of the sun, and was easy to protect from both men and animals_ Last but not leas, it had to have a view of the sea so I could easily spot a ship passing nearby. found a little plain next to a steep hill and decided to pitch my tent there. The hill would protect me from one side and I would build a fence on all other sides. I used the cables from the ship to tie strong sharp stakes together. There was no door, but I was using a short ladder to go over the fence, which I would then take with me inside the fortification. I brought all my belongings inside and made two tents — a bigger one from the hill to the fence and a small one inside it I needed the bigger one to protect the powder and the food from the torrential rain, I was going to live in the smaller one where I had brought the hammock and was using it instead of a bed. When T had finished with the ten, I started digging at the bottom of the hill. I was bringing the stones and ea. I would get from there to the fence_ In this way I made a terrace on the inner side of the fence. The hole at the bottom of the hill I .tended (0 use as a cellar. One day I was .11 working on the cave when a storm appeared. There was lighming, followed by a deafening thunder. it crossed my mind that a single lightning bolt falling on one of the barrels with pow-der could destroy everything I've done and even kill me_ I was terrified. As soon as the storm went away I opened the barrels and started dividing the powder into bags and pouch., boxes and parcels, which I then hid in the rocks. As I had a lot of powder, this took me two weeks. Meanwhile, I went hunting every day. It was a break from the hard work and it provided me with meat. I also familiar.. myself with the island and its inhabitants_ I discovered goats and killed one. It had a little .d by it which followed me when I took its mother. I was hoping I could tame it but it would not eat so I had to .11 it as well. 
Chapter 17 
Some days I was very .d because I felt living on this island alone was meaningless. I would often walk along the beach regretting my choice to travel by sea. What was keeping me was the thought that I was saved in the great storm which killed my friends and I should be thankful for that Then I would remind myself how lucky I had been to take all the tools, food, clothes and guns from the ship, for without them I would hardly have survived a week I decided to make a big cross and .t it on the shore where I first set foot 011 this .land. I wrote on it that I had arrived here on the 30th of September 1659. i wanted to keep track of time so I would make a small cut in the cross to mark every day. The seventh cut was longer to mark the end of the wee, The beginning of each month was also a longer cut. later on while opening the chests and other box. which I had brought from the ship I discovered pens, ink, pap., compass., maps and books. I had also taken the two cats we had on board the ship with me. There was also a dog on our ship. It swam after me the very first day I went to the ship and followed me everywhere after that. I was very hat, to have the animals as companions, but I only .shed they would speak to me! It took me a year to finish making my small fortification as it was very ha. work. Meanwhile I was thinking a lot about my condition and to relieve my mind from all my dark thoughts 1 made a list of all good and bad things that had happened to me. First of all,1 was sorry for myself because T was all alone on this island and had little hope of ever going back to civilization. On the other hand, i was .ved and did not die in the storm which killed my friends. I was alone on the island but I was not starving. I did not have any good cloth., but the wthther was such that I hardly needed any. My only sorrow was having no one to talk to, but I was saved and could take care of myself. This list helped me realize that all bad things come with something good in them. 
Chapter 18 

I continued improving my little house. I made a wall of earth behind the fence and once it was as high as the fence, I put boards on it I also kept on digging into the rock and when I realized there were no wild beasts on the island I made the cave larger. Bigger space in the rock allowed me to store all my belongings in some order. Then i proceededR to make myself some furniture. I badly needed a chair and a table for my accommodation. I used the boards from my rafts and the ship to furnish myself with these two commodities. Next I made shelves inside the cave. 1 arranged my tools on diem. My clothes and guns were hanging there as well. I was very pleased with my work. The cave was comfortable now, everything was in order and I could easily find whatever I needed. It was then that I decided to start a journal. I would describe my daily activities in it. it would do me good to put my thoughts to paper. I started by writing down my experiences from the very first day on the island. I continued desaibing how I spent my time after that and kept on doing this every day until i ran out of Mk. 
Chapter 19 
This M my journal. 
September 30th, 1659 My name is Robinson Crusce and I have shipwrecked on this island. which I have named 'The Island of Despair, Everyone else who was on the ship with me drowned and I am left here all alone. 
October 1st In the morning I saw that the ship M closer to the land than before. I swam to it and started bringing things to the beach. I kept doing this every day of October. 
October 25th It rained a lot and the ship broke to pieces. 1 could no longer take things from it The end of October I spent building my fortification. On the last day of the month I explored the island and killed a goat with its Md. The first couple of days of November 1 spent arranging the chests and boards I have taken from the ship as a fence around my tent. 
November 4th T decided to make a schedule in order to organise my time better. Every morning i walked for a few hours, then worked until 11, had lunch, took a nap between 12 and 14, and continued working until the evening. That same day I started making a table, which took me longer than expected. 1 finished it the next evening. 
Chapter 21 
January tit I explored the island and found more goats in the valleys in the center of the island. The animal, were very shy, which made it difficult to approach them. Still, I decided to my to tame a few when i got the chance. The next day 1 returned with my dog, but they all attacked him, so I did not have much success. I spent the period between January and April working on my fence. It took me a long time because I wanted to make it very thick and strong. Meanwhile I found pigeons on the island. They weren't nesting in the trees, but M holes of the rocks. This made them easy to capture and their meat was good. This is what i was surviving on while working on my fortification. I soon found myself missing many commodities. For example, I badly needed candles. Without them I had to stop work at 7 which was the time when it was getting dark on the island T tried using goat fat instead of wax, but this did not work out well and the light wasn't very strong. While cleaning and arranging my fortification, I found a small bag. There used to be con inside, but now there were only some leaves and dust at the bottom of it. I emptied it outside my fortification because I needed the bag for gunpowder. This was just before the rains and about a month later I was surprised to find a few green leaves growing there. It turned out (0 be barley. Next to it there was another familiar plant — rice. I remembered emptying another bag at that place. Words cannot express how happy I was to discover these plants growing just outside my door. It was mid-April when I finally finithed building my fortification. There was no door because i had decided to use a ladder to climb over the wall. This way there was no sign of anyone living there at all_ 
Chapter 22 
On April 1. 1 was inside my house when I felt pieces of earth falling from the roof of my cave. I was frightened and thought all , efforts would be lost again. I ran outside the cave. Suddenly I noticed that the ground was shaking 

everywhere. It was an earthquake, was paralyzed with fear. I felt sea-sick as if I were on a ship. All of a sudden a large rock fell into the coastal warms with a terrible splash. Although the earthquake was soon over, I was afraid to go inside the fortification.' was sitting on the ground M front of my house .11 very much upset and scared to enter. 1 did not even notice it was getting cloudy and the wind was getting stronger. A terrible storm was approaching. There were enormous waves in the sea and on the ground trees were torn up by their roots. This lasted for three terrifying hours. Then a heavy downpour began. I thought that the storm and the rain were the consequentes of the earthquake, so i gathered courage and went back inside my fortification. T. started me thinking about moving my tent to an open space where there was less risk of being butted alive during an earthquake. I was scared the cave might fall dawn the very next time the mound starts to shake again. i decided LO make a but on a plain. For protection, I would surround it by a wall. I spent the end of April trying to prepare and sharpen the tools I would need for building the hut. 
Chapter 23 
On June 16th T found a large turtle on the beach. I cooked it and its meat turned out to be delicious. Tn the last week of June T fell sick. I had a fever and I couldn't get out of bed_ 1 was very afraid. I had horrible nightmares because of the fever, 1 was very weak, and could not get food or water. A few days later when I felt a bit better I looked through my belongings and found a few green leaves of tobacco. I dewed some of them and put some in rum, which I then drank Soon I was feeling better. On July 3rd 1 was well again. The next ten days I spent walking around the island. This exercise improved my health. When I felt strong again, I decided to explore the whole Wand_ I found new plains and meadows where T saw some tobacco plants among other unknown on.. The next day I found melons and grapes. I dried and preserved the grapes as raisins. 
Chapter 24 
Soon I found cocoa trees There were also orange, lemon and citron trees on the island which I had not noticed before_ made a pile of the fruits I gathered and manned to my house to get a bag for them. When I return. I found the fruits scattered. Some were eaten, some were stepped upon. I conduded from this that there are some wild beasts around. Still, 1 liked that fruit.' valley and I began thinking about moving my tent there. Then I remembered that the beach was far away from that valley and would not see if any ship passed by. Instead of settling there, I decided to .Id another house there, which 1 would visit from time to time. made a small hut and then surrounded it with a double fence. Again I was using a ladder to go in and out of it This whole bushman took me the whole of July and the beginning of August_ it was then that the rainy season started and continued until the middle of October.' was mostly inside my fortification during this time. Confined indoors, I started expanding the cave again until I came out the other .side of the hill. I made a hole there and now I had a door for my house. Meanwhile one of my cats had .appeared and now returned with three little kittens. Taking care of them, I was indoors that season, eating what I had gathered before. I went hunting only a few times. I killed a goat and on. I found a large tortoise. I was surviving on this meat and on the raisins which I had dried before_ 
Chapter 25 
September, 30th I have been on this island for a year now.' noticed my ink was nmning out, so I dropped writing in the journal every day. After the rains ended I returned to my valley but to find the branches M the fence all green, With new leaves growing all over them. This was not only beautiful but also useful to me because soon my but was covered entirely and was hardly visible. The leaves kept shadow over it and it was very pleasant to stay in there during the dry season_ I liked it so much that I decided to make a fence from the same branches around my first fortification as well With the end of the rainy season I thought now was the right time to sow the barley and rice grains from the stalks outside my house. I was cautious so I only sowed two-thirds of the grains. This was fortunate because none of these grains came up as the next couple of months were extremely dry. I planted the rest of the seeds I had just before the next rainy season and they came up alright. T. experience made me notice that there are two rainy and two dry seasons on the island With this in mind, I could now plan when to sow mains. Soon I realized I needed baskets. I cut branches from the same tree which I used for both my fences. After drying these branch., I used diem to make baskets. When I finished that, I decided to take another, longer trip around the island. T. time I could take more food with me, now that I had the bask.. After I had passed the valley where my but was, I went down the beach. It was then that I saw land an out at sea. It 

must have been a bigger island or even the con.ent of South America. 
Chapter 26 
After this discovery, I continued exploring the is.nd and fotmd pleasant savannah fields. I aLso discovered that there were many parrots, har. and foxes at this side of the island. I even caught one parrot and took it me. There were also numerous turtles, tortoises and birds, Mcluding penguins. Th. part of the island was more pleasant and there was more food but I did not want to move my fortification. I kept on wandering, but I got Imt and it took me a few days to find my way badc to the beach where I had seen die land at the d.tance. From there I knew hmv to get home again. On the way back my dog captured a young kid which I saved and took with me. I was determined to breed tame goats and now I was offered another chance. I left the kid M the hut until I prepared a space for it in my fortification_ I dr. from the trip that on my return I relax. for a few days. I made a cage for the parrot a. brought home the kid, which was very .ne by now. 
C.pter 27 
The year .d passed so quiddy and soon it w. September again. I have been on die island two years now. I was no longer as sad and desperate .1 was immedia.y af. the shipwreck. I had grown to accept my destiny and was thankful for being well and alive. 1. kept my daily schedule. was hunting in the morning, cooking at lunchtime, relaxing in the afternoon when it was the hottest, and working in the evening. My work was difficult and time-consuming. For example, it took me 42 days to make a shelf out of a big board. In the months of November and December I was occupied with my crop of rice and barley. The goats and the wild .res were eating the stalks of both as soon as they came up. I risk. lacing all of it, so I quickly made an enclosure around place where I had sown the rice and barley. I would also de my dog there to guard my crops at night Soon the stalks were tall, but then another danger appeared. Birds of all kinds started eating the grains. I shot some and kept an eye on my crops until the rest of the birds were gone. At the end of December reaped my first crop. I thd not have any tools to cut it properly, clean or grind the grains, so I decided to leave it all for seed. Meanwhile I began preparing the too. I would n. in a year, time. spent the next rainy season doing and I also taught the parrot to say its name, Poll. I realized I needed earthen pots to keep the grain. I I.ked for day around the island. I found some and a. two months of experiments I succeeded M maldng two large jars. To protect them better I put them M vricker baskets and placed rice and barley straws between the basket and the clay pot. Th. way I furnished myself with pots for the grains. Now that I knew how, I con.. maMng myself small pots, plat., pitrJiers One day, quite by accident, I found a broken piece of one of my po. in the fire. The heat had turned it hard as stone and red as a tile. I used this observation and placed several pots one upon the other. Then Tset fire around them. After a few hours they were all very hard and the bottom one was even glazed, because the sand under it had melted and turned Mto glass. 
Chapter 28 
I still felt an acute need for so many tools and facilities. For example, I needed an instrument to grind the grads and I chose a big block of hani wood for that. To make bread out of the ground grains I also needed a sieve. I used seamen, dothes for that a. although from perfect, I managed to make three small sieves whidi served me well for a couple of years. I kept making clay p.. I found a way to make myself something which resembled an oven. 1 made big earthen plates and would put the bread loaf between them, then cover them all with ha embers. This . how I made my first bread on the island. It was in the third year of my shipwreck. From .e to time I was .11 thinking of nmnMg to the beach and waiting for a ship to pass by. Ye, I did not .ow whether my condition might not he worse in that case. What if I was cap.ed by cannibals? One day I remembered that my ship, boat was .11 at the beach where the storrn had left it went to look for it. When I did, I tried ix, turn it the right way, but it was buried in sand. spent a month doing this, but it was useless. I could not even move it. I could not turn or repair it properly. I left the boat there, but my desire to go sailing was just as strong as before. I was contemplating whether could make myself a canoe out of some great tree. I found a big one, cut it and carved it Then I cut out the inside and burned it until T reached the desir. shape. It was only then that I discovered that I had no way of moving it out of the forest and into the beach. It was to my greatest thsappointment that I had to leave it there. I was a fool. It took me nearly half a year to make the canoe and the thought of how I w. going to latmdi it in water never crossed my mind once. I tried everythMg to move the canoe. I even considered dgging a canal from the beadi to where the canoe lay, but it w. iseless. There was a hffi between them and it would have ta.n me many years to dig the canal through die hill and push the canoe in it. Eventually I gave up on the canoe a.. it there . a reminder to myself. 

Chapter 29 
Halfway through my work on the canoe, my fourth year on the island passed. I was removed from the world, yet I had enough to live on and I was content. Some changes had occurred in that nme. I had run out of ink completely and my cloth. were decaying with use. Instead I began using the skins of the animals I had killed. I made myself a cap and a pair of clothes entirely out of those .dns They kept me cool in the heat and preserved me from the heavy rain. But the clothes weren't enough. I also needed an tunbreth for the same purposes. It took me a while but I succeed. in making one. I continued living like that for the next 5 years. Nothing curious hap,. in that time. I kept on plan.g barley and rice. I continued drying grapes to make raisins. All my a.vities remained the same. it was some time after that I ma. myself another .noe. It was sm.er and easier to move. Although it was ready and set M water, could not use that canoe to go in the ocean. It could only serve me to navel around the island .th Before I made a sail, I had put food, water and tools M it to prepare for the thp ahead_ It was the 6th of November on the sixth year of my stay on the island that I started this voyage. I faced thnger as soon as I set out. I had to go round some rocks far out at sea, and then struggle again.st a very strong underwater current, but I fin.y managed to continue my trip mund the island. Fin.y I found a small river going further into the land where harboured my boat and went to explore this side of the island on foot. It was not far from where I had been on my previous journey. I even succeeded M finding my way back to my hut, where everything was j. as I had left it. I was so tired from the trip that I fell asleep and was woken up by sorneone calling my name: "Robin Crusoe, where are you? Poor Robin," l was terrified at first, but then I saw my parrot Poll on , of the hedge. He had leamt the phrases I had repeated to myself so many times. Now he was saying thern with the same intonation I had us.. I was surprised to find the parmt here, because I had left it in the fortification. Still, I was happy to hear someorte talk to me. I left the boat there and returned home .th the parrot. 

Chapter 30 
I did not take such long nip' s for a year and was staying M my fortification m. of the time. I kept on ma.g wo.en tools and day pots. I even devised a way to make pots .th a wheel, which made my work much lighter:1.o figured out how to make a tobacco pipe, which to be fair, I missed a lot ever sin. I wa.s shipwreck. on the island. With time I got better at ma.g baskets. I noticed my gunpowder had diminished significantly. I was wonied I wouldn't be able to Idll any more gthts once it was gone. The kid I tamed had grown old, but I did not have a chance to tame a male cm, so the female th. of old age. I did not have the heart to kill it It was eleven years since I first sm foot on this island and all this time I was using gunpowder to ,vide myself with meat Now I thought of finding some other way to supply myself .th fthd and spare what was left of the ammunition. I rnade traps and pithlls and although I did not succeed at first, eventually 1 caught a male goat M one pit and three young ones in the other. They were one male .d two females. 1 let go of the old goat but took the kith .th me. had to make an enclosure for them because I feared they might run away .th dm .1d on. on. they matured. it took me three mond, but I made a hedge around a stfitable space where there was plenty of grass and water for them. Meanwhile the kids had become very tame and were eating out of my hand. In a year and a half's time I had a small flock of twelve gthts, and M three years' time had more than forty goats. This way I was supplied .th milk and meat. T experimented several times and at 1.1 managed to make cheese and butter. My table was full now and I was surrounded by animals. I had my old dog, cats goats and P., my parrot The only thing I still missed was someone to talk to. 

Chapter 31 
I was uneasy and wan. to go to that pan of the island where the dangerous water currents ran. One thy set out to reach that part of the island. On the way there I thought to myself how ridiculous I must have appeared in the eyes of an Englishman. I .d a big hat, a short jacket and Imee-length trousers all ma. out of goatskin. I did not have socks or shoes but had used some laces and ti. some goatskin aromd my feet. 1 had nvo belts — one for the sword and .fe, and one for the gunpowder. On my back I had a basket. I also carried a gun on my shoulder and an umbrvIla made out of goats. above my heath My bean! and moustadies were pretty long. 1 r.lized I was looking very unttsual from what I used to wear years ago. One day, about lunthtime, 1 was walking on the beach got'', check on my boat when I came acmss something surprising. I saw the mark of a human footstep on die sand looked around but I could not see anyone. I was terrified. I hurried back to my fortification and fastened the door. I was so scar. I could not sl.p that night. Why was there no boat? Why were there no more footprints? I was horrified and started thinking that perhaps i had imagin. it all. After a I decided that it must be the step of one of the savages who pro.bly inhabit. the is.. around. I began to worry whether they had seen my boat and were now preparing to attack me. Then I thnvinced myself that may. I had seen the mark of my own foot and I had been a fool to get scared by it This realization made me .1 more confident and after 3 days of hithng finally left my fortification. 1 milk. the goam and then, once I had gathered courage, I went CO s. the footstep again. When I approached I saw .t it was very unlikely .t I had passed that way when going to my boat. Moreover, the step was much bigger than the sMe of my foot. It was impossible that the step was m.e. scared again. That Mght I considered letting all my animals into the wild, destroying my crops and my summer house so that no trace of human .bitation M left on the island. I was so afraid that could not fall asleep whole night_ On the morning I finally doz. off and when I woke up my head was clear. Now it thd not seem that strange that there should be people on the islands around. Perhaps they come to the shore of my island occasionally or now the w.d carried them this way for the first time. T remem.red that for the fifteen years' had been on the isMnd I had never seen another human .ing or discovered any signs of a setdement here. Ibis ca.. me down. 

Chapter 32 
Still, I took precautions for my safety. I made another .11 around my fortification and left holes through which I could easily fire several grms if attack.. In two years' rime I had mch a strongly fortified house surround. with walls and thick noes that no one could come near me. 1 was also concerned for my flock of goats. divided the animals and built a small enclosure in another part of the island. It took me lots of time and effort, hitt in the end my animals were safe from any unexpected attack. It was now two years since I had seen the footstep on the beach. One day as I was walking towards the thore I thought I saw a boat. the distance. I could not be sure, so I just confirmed my vmlk. It was then that 1 thme across sc.ething terrifying. The whole heath was covered .11 human remains. Skulls, ban. and feet were scattered all over the place and there was a black cit,e where a fire must have been set up. I was sick and threw up at the horrible sight Terrified and thsgusted, i went back to my fortification .d again considered wh. to do. I decided to give up going out at sea with my boat because t. thnnibals could capture me. I also stopped firing guns for I fear. being discover. by the sound. Every time I went out of my fortification I carried pistols .d a gun to protect myself in the case of a sudden attack. 

Chamer 33 
Soon I started thinking how I could la some of the cannibals and save their vithms if I could. If that was not possible, at least I could frighten them so they would never come nearby aga.. I began looking at that side of the Mland where I had first seen the human footprint. I want. to find a hithng place for myself and prepare it for the attack Then I changed my mind and thought it was unreasonable to fight them since they had not done any harm to me. Eventually I gave up the preparations altogether .d decided to act only if .y attacked me first. For a whole year 1 was hiding my frac. as well as I could. I put away my boat and removed every sail and other equipment from it. I 1, myself octhpied with my an.als and crops, but I was very careMl. was afraid to make loud noises and 1 was very anxious every time I made a fire in case the smoke could be seen from a distan.. Once when I w. cutting some branches I thscovered a hollow place which on further inspection appeared to be a small cave. I went .side it but . soon as my eyes grew comfonable with the dar.ess I noticed two brig,ht ey. looking at me. jumped outside, scared to death. In bright daylight 1 gathered courage and went . again hut then a loud sigh scared me out again. It samded as if there was someone injured inside. The third time I lit a torch and went in to discover . old goat dying in the cave. returned to the cave die next day to find that the gOat had died. I explored the place and found it very safe. It would make a convethent hiding place near the beach. That M why I brought some of my guns and some powder there. 

Chapter 34 
Twenty-three years had passed since I set foot on this island. Now I was living comfortably and had many creanues to keep me company_ Poll was repeating my name very pleasantly. I .d two more parrots after Poll and I had taught all of them to pronounce my name My dog had died in the 160 year of our stay on the island, but the cats had multiplied. T was still keeping thr. of them as well as a few lcids around me. T had caught and tamed .me seabin. and they were also living in my fortification. It was the last month of my 23rd year on the island when, as I was walking to my fields early one motning, I saw fire on the shore. It was on my side of the island, away from the place where 1 had found signs of savages before. I immediately returned to my fortification and loaded all guns. Despite all this, I was impatient, . to. my telescope and went close to the beadt hid myself and observed them. I saw 9 naked savages who had come .th 2 canoes. It .emed that they were waiting for the tide to leave the island. As soon as they left I went to the .ore and found out that there had been 3 more canoes had not seen. The beach was Honed .th flesh a. bon. again. This made me sick and angry and I resolved to Idll . many of them as I could the next time I .w them. They did not return for another 15 month. In May the follo.ng year I .w them again and it w. a good occasion to intervene and fight them. MeanwMle something else happened that dismrbed my routine. One evening I was startled out of my ordinary acti.ti. by the sound of a ganshot at sea. I had jot got out of my house when I saw a flash coming fmm the sea. A second gunshot followed_ It crossed my mind that this must all be corning from some ship in danger asking for help_ I gathered all the dry wood could find arotmd and ran to the beach where]. made a big fire. They saw me and fired again. I kept the fire until the morning but there was no .sign of them. As the day broke, 1.w .mething far away at .a. I thought they must have anchored there, but when I looked again from the top of a hill 1.w that there were only wrecks left of the ship. It had been destroyed on the rocks where the strong underwater currents ran. 

Chapter 35 
longeddsodmucil: to sl Tee of thie .il:s T bdeach. uld have given everything to talk to another human being A few days later I found the corpse of a drowned boy on the beach, but 1 could not guess his nationality from his clothes. I found a tobacco pipe M his pockets, though, and this was very valuable to me. I took my boat and decided to go to the shipwreck to see if there w. any creature sMI alive on board I observed the currents and chase the least dangerous way. The next morning I was ready and reached the wreck M less than 2 hours. The .ip .emed Spanish by construct, but was completely destroy.. When I went closer, a dog appear. on the d.k and I fed it bread and water because it w. starved a. extremely thirsty_ I found only two dead men on the slUp, but there was so sign of .yone else. There were .veral chests and big .sks of some alcohol, but the latter were too heavy to move. When I.arched arotmd 1 found another, smaller cask of liquor which I managed to p. to my boat. 1 also found guns and gunpowder. I left the wapons because I had plenty of them. but I took the powder and some other useful things I found on board. In die evening I returned to the island and spent the night in die boat. The next morning I decided to bring MI 1 had finmd to my cave instead of taking it to die fortifi.tion. Once they were there, 1 opened the chests and found more liquor in them. There was al. meat, some sh. and handkerchiefs, as well as gold and other trea.res. In the last chest found some very fine gunpowder which was of great valne to me. On the island, it was much more valuable than any money or precious metals. There was something else which I needed just as badly as powder and that was shoes. I had taken the shoes off the feet of the two drowned men on board the ship and I found two more pairs in one of the CinSt.S. 

Chapter 36 
After I had senn-ed all my new po.essions in the cave, I hid the boat again and went badc to my fortification. returned to my pre.ous life, only I was more .gilant and .entive than before. Thne was pa.ing and I w. often thinking about the people I had seen on the beach. I was wondering whether I had any chance of survival if I went to sea with rny boat. These thoughts were always in the badt my mind, .y and night. It was one night in March when I dreamed that 2 canoes with savages .d on the beach. One of their yi.ms ran away and mme towards my fortification where I saved . and he .elt to me and became my servani He help. me navigate out of the dangerous currents around the island T woke up, but this was all stuck in my mind. 1 realized that if I had a savage to help me I might be able to escape frorn the island and reach the continent_ Perhaps I could save one of the yi.ms brought to this isl.d to be eaten. I made up rny mind to look out for the savag. and for the next year and a half I would go daily around the beach, hcping to see canoes. This finally happened one morning. T was in my fortification when I saw 5 cano..th more than thirty men on the shore. I could not attack them since they were too many, so I just waited, observing them thmugh my telescope. They had a fire set up and were dancing arotmd it. also saw two men, probably victims, tied together. A.r a w.le the two tied men were brought to the fire. One was beaten with a club and the other was left stanthng. .tile the savages were preparing to eat the first one, the second one started to run tower. me. was frightened he would make my fortification .own to the others, but soon I saw that he was followed not by the whole group. but only by three savages and he was quickly outrtmning them. 

Chapter 37 
The victim reached the small river where I used to anchor my boat and he had to swim to the other side. He thd that, and con.u. running towards the mainland. Two of the Rsavages follcnved him while the third one returned to the feast on the beach. It occurred to me that now was the right moment to save the victim. Taldng two guns, I ran down the ladder out of my fortification. I ran to the river and as soon as reached the two savages 1 .ocIced .wn the first. On seeing this, the second one prepared ro shoot an arrow at me, so T had no choice but to shoot h.. The victim they were chasing stoop. sdll when he heaM the gunshot. beckoned to . to come close, but he was shaking with fear. I smiled at . and kept maldng gestures to invite nearer, so he approached. He would stop every few steps to kneel to thank me for saving his life. When he reached me he .elt down, kissed the ground and laid his head on it. Then he took my foot and put it on .s head. I lift. him, but there was another d.ger now. The savage I had hit was recovering. S.ing this, the one I had saved said a few words to me. I did not u.erstand anything, but it was extremely pleasant to hear someone talk to me. The man I had sav. made a g.ture to .k for my sword, and taking it, cut off the head of his pursuer. After [ha he took the head and the sword and laid them both in front of me. Then he wanted to go to the savage had thot_ Apparently he had never seen a gun before and was astonish. by my a.ons when I had saved him. He went to the Imdy, turned . anotmd and looked at the hole the bullet had left on the bre.t. He took the bow and arrows from the dead man and retumed IO me. He .signed to me that we should bury the bodies and him do it. He .g out two big hol. in the sand and in 15 minutes the bodies were gone. I took . to my cave. There 1 gave him bread and raisins and some water. He was so exhaust. that soon as he lay down he fell asleep. 

Chapter 38 
Now I had an opportunity to look at him. He was young and strong. He must have been around 26. He had .g black hair, fine skin and pleasant face. I left him sleeping and went outside to milk the goats. Half an hour later he came out refreshed and again made gestur. to me CO expre. his gratitude. He put my foot on his hmd to show his submission to me. In return I show.. I w. very pleased with him. I began speaking to him. I named h. Friday after the .y when I sav. his life and I instructed him to call me `Master'. I told . my name and I taught . `yes' and 'no'. Then drank some milk and soaked my bread M it, before giving it to .. He followed my example and did the same. We remain. in the cave that night, but the next day I made him follow me outside. Using ges..1 told him I would give . some cloth., because he w. naked. As we were passing the beach he show. me where he had b.. the two savages. He made signs to me to help him thg diem out and eat them. This suggestion angered me immensely. I ges.ed to him that he should forget about this and follow me instead. T was determined he would not have anything to do with them at all, . he quic.y resigned and we walked away. We went on top of the hill and through my telescope I saw that the canoes were gone and we were alone on the island. I want. to be .re so I gave Friday a sword and the bow and arrows we had taken from one of the savag. and we made for t. beach. My heart sunk when saw what had remained of the feast Them were human bon. scattered all around, pieces of flesh here and there and the sand was red vAth blood. I cotmted three skulls, five hands, .veral feet and of other body parts which chilled my blood. 

Chapter 39 
Friday sign. to me that there had heen four prisoners altogether and tha he had been the fourth one to be killed and eaten. I saw that even now he .1 wanted to eat human flesh so once again I expre.ed my thsgthst at the thought. 1 gesmred to him that I would kill him if he ate human flesh again. Then I asked him to collect all the human remains on the beach a. bum them in a big fire. After that we return. to the cave and I supplied Friday with cloth.. 1 gave him trousers, a .ort jacket and a cap made out of hare s.n. At first he was uncomfortable but then he got used to h. new appearance. The followthg day I brought him to my fortification. I made a little tant for him between the two fences surrounding my place. I took all his weapons a.y, barred the door and hid all the ladders d.ng the Mght, so he could not come inside. After a while I real.. that this wasn't necessary at all, because Friday was a very faithful and hon.t man. He was like a child to me and I was like a father to him. On many occasions later he showed me he would sacrifice . life to .ve mine. 
T was very happy to have Friday arotmd and I began teaching . everything he needed to .ow to serve me well. paMcularly wan. to teach him to speak to me and understand my words. He was a thligent student and quickly .proved. T. tnade me so happy that I thd not care anout leaving the .land anymore. His pre.nce was a great delight to me. 

Chapter 40 
Two or three days later, decided to teach Friday not to eat human flesh anymore. From now I wanted to get h. accustomed to animal meat instead. Therefore we went to the forest and I shot a .d. Once again Friday was terrified from the gun.ot. He thought I wanted to .11 him. He ripp. off . shin to check if I bad wounded him. Then he .elt dovm and said something to me. I did not understand it but it seem. he was begging me not to kill .. I reassured him I thd not have die slightest thtention of doing this and panned at the .d. Then I showed him my , and killed a bird on a tree nearby. He was surprised a. for quite a long afterwards he would not come close to touch a gun. On, late, I found him tallang to the gun. He must have been a.s.ng it not to kill him.

The next day we roasted some of the kid's meat and he liked it very much. He gestured to me that he would never eat human fl.h agani. Soon I taught Friday how to prepare com and bake bread out of it and in a few days he could do it . well . I_ Then we started expanthng my garden and he help. me plant more corn. In all a.viti. Friday was of great help. He w. talking mom and more every day and I immensely enjoyed h. company. 

Chapter 41 
One day I asked him about his tribe and the way he was taken a pr.oner. He told me that they us. to eat human fl.h just like their opponents. In fact he had taken , in that ritual on die other side of my island. He must have been one of the savages I had seen feast there a long time ago. He a.o explained that no canoe w. ever lost coming to my island. After an explanation of the currents which they had to struggle with to come here I was finally able to figure out where the island was located. The land to the west and northwest was Trinidad. He also told me he had previously seen people with beards like mine. From his account I supposed they had been Spaniards. He had heard about them and their cruelties to other tribes. He knew which lands they had taken and settled On. He even knew how we can reach them .in two canoes". I thrl not get that at first, but it seemed to me he meant that we would need a boat as big as two canoes_ From Friday, account I leamed about the traditions and beliefs of his people. I also told him my story and i described England and Europe to him. When I felt I could trust h. enough, I showed him how ,powder works and taught him how to use a gun_ I gave him a knife, a hatchet and a belt LO carry them on. He was delighted with my presents. I showed him where my ship had crashed and the remains of the boat with which I had been saved. He said he had seen a boat like that before. When I inquired further he explained that his nation had saved whlte men from a similar boat and that they were .11 living with them. He counted seventeen Europeans living with his people. 

Chapter 42 
It crossed my mind that these might be the sailors from the ship I had seen crash on the rocks a few years ago. They might have saved themselves in a boat because I did not find one when I went on board to look for remains. T asked Friday to tell me more about them. He assured me that they were well and had been living with his people for four years. One day Friday and I were on top of a hill. The weather was Mee and the sky was clear so we could see quite far. Suddenly Friday be, jumping and dancing. When I asked . about the reason he said he could see his land from here. I could see on his face he was excited to see home. This made me devise a new plan M my head. At first I thought that if Friday returns to his people he would forget everything I had taught him and he would betray me. Then his people would come here and eat me. I got jealous and afraid, but with every action Friday was convincing me he was a loyal and sincere friend to me. He told me his nation had learned a lot from the white men and that if we built a canoe and went to his home island, he would tell his people how I had saved his life and had taken good care of him. 
It was dear he wanted us both to go there and when I indipted that perhaps it would be better if he went alone, he took a hatchet and asked me to .11. rather than send him away from me. This enc.raged me and since I wanted to meet the Europeans I thought we could go to the other side of the Wand. There I showed Friday my .at but he said it was too small for the two of us. Then I brought him to see the first one I had made. It was the boat that was so big that I could not move it By now it had dried up and was getting rotten, but Friday approved of its size and found it suitable for the voyage. SOU) we started building the canoe we needed. We those and cut a big tree and I showed . how to cut the inside so as to form a boar. It took us a month to do this and two weeks more to drag it to the beach. 

Chapter 43 
As it awn. ott,eparing sails and an anchor was much more difficult than I had expected. Most of the linen I had and the sails I had taken from the wreciced ships had rotted, but I found and stitched two pieces to make a big sail It took us a bit longer to make and fit the boat with a rudder. On the other hand, a mast was easy enough to make and with Friday, help it took us no time at all. Still, two months had passed while we finished all preparations and furnished the boat_ Friday knew how to navigate a boat but had never seen a mast and a sail, so I had to instruct him how to use them. Meanwhile the twenty-seventh year of my stay on the island had come. The lag three years I had spent with Friday and they were much different frcm the time before I met him. I knew that perhaps I wouldn't stay muds longer on this island, now that we had the canoe ready, but I still continued working M the garden and looking after my animals  The rainy season came upon us, so we built a small dam for the boat and we covered it with leaves. These preserved it from the torrential rains and at the same time kept it hidden from human eyes. The rainy season also gave us enough time to plan our voyage. After it finished we started storing provisions M the boat. T/ne day I had sent Friday to the beach to get a tortoise, when he came back running. Before i had even had a chance to ask him, he cried out that there were three canoes on the beach. 

Chapter 44 was terrified because he thought the cannibals had returned to look for him. He was shaking with fear. so I comfort. him best as I could and gave him some nrm. Then I loaded several pistols and guns and gave him a hatchet, while I took my sword. We went on top of a trill a. through rny mlescope I could see 21 savages, 3 victuns and 3 canoes on the beach. They had laded closer to my cave where the forest was reaching the beach. This ma. it easier to attack them and prevent the cruel victory ritual. 
now=7h. `nPianned,Y,thr`prwhhthol= wma=7,,,TrY.11,'„VcchluanthgeeZyPiethnteZons"td 
now I thought I would only observe them until I had a reason to .erfere. When we were very cl.e to the beach, asked Fri.y to go behind a very large n-ec and see what he could from there. He returned to me the cannibals were all around the fire, eating one of di. prisoners, while another one lay tied up. The .cond pri.ner was not one of Friday's people, but one of the beard. Europeans,. filled me horror and I was resolved to save him if I could. We moved closer to the place where the savages were gathered. Nineteen of them were .11 round the fire, but two had gone to fetch the poor white man. SeeMg this, I loaded the guns and .ked Friday to do exactly what I thd. We fired at the .me CITTIC and killed 3 and wounded 5 of the savages. The rest jump. up to their feet, but did not know which way to run because they thd not know from which direction the danger was coming. Meanwhile we had loaded the guns again and shot tWO more, again wounding a few. After that we load. the guns again and ran to die beach, shouting as loud as we can. i ran to the ti. prisoner and .k. Friday to shoot the savag. who had left him and were now in the nearest canoe.While he was figh.g vAth them, I cut the ropes which the European w. bound with. I asked him who he was and he said in Latin that he was Spanish. 

Chapter 45 
I gave h. a pistol and my sword, and with the li.e Span. I .ew I ask. him to help us .f.t the cannibak The savages were startled by our sudden attack. Our unusual guns scared diem even more, so we were quickly winning. ask. Friday to get us the guns we had left loaded by the big tree. I sat dovm to load the ones we had just u.sed. When I turned around, I saw die Spaniard w. fighting with a savage. Although brave, the Spaniard was weak and the savage was going to kill him. I ran to help h., but at the Int moment the Spaniard threw away the sword and ta.ng a pistol sha the .vage down. On his way to get the rest of the guns, Friday had used h. hatchet to fin. off die woimd. savages. The Spaniard wounded two mare, but they managed to run away. One ran to forest, vthere Thday kill. him with his hau:het, but the other one swam to one of the rano. There were three people in it, one of which was wounded. Those were . only on. that had e.aped. Friday .ot at them, but did na wound them. it was dangerous to let them go because they would tell thefr people about us and would demand revenge. Friday and I jumped in one of their canoes to chase them, but to OUT surpr. we found another tied person on the bottom. He was scared because he had not s.n the fight, but only h.rd it. The ropes were so tight around his neck that he w. goMg to the SOOft if I did not cut them. 

Chapter 46 
The savage was shaking .th fear a. exhaustion, so I asked Friday to come near and . to the prisoner. I gave him some rum and vthen Friday came, I ask. h. to explain to the prisoner that we had just saved him from the hanth of the cannibals. I was surprised to see Friday ay, then laugh and kiss the savage. My friend jumped and began dancing around. moving his hands and beating his Mce. Then he cried and laughed at the same time, so it was a while before I could make him talk to me. When the ...citement w. over. Friday told me .t the pri.ner we had just say. was his own father. it brought tears to my ey. to .e the affection the sat showed for his father. Friday returned to the boat and held his father, head to his chest Then he rubb. his father, hands and feet %Atli h. hands to wann him up. I gave h. sane rum to rub in and soon Fri.y's father was feeling much better. This happy incident had delayed us and it was no point pursuing die savages who escaped. They were ahnost out of sight by now. It all turned out well, because two hours later a terrible !And app.. and con.ued the whole night. I doubt the survivors had reached their island at 

Chapter 47 
Friday was . excited to see his father again, that I thd not dare disrupt them. Ye, after a while I ulled Friday to ask him if he had given his father some bread to cat. in his happiness, he had forgotten to do so. That is why I gave him the rest of the bread I had, some rum and a handful of raisins. He gave all this to his father, but suddenly he jumped out of the canoe and ran to the forest as fast . he cs.d. I called after Mm, but it w. no use — he thd not even hear me. riree.7beutt'llical=e Pariarlus,Taetlr;ecr ilYtiong anc;ialthng=1:_fAfrftesher hwe=danran'trves Ifee'llegatet',7= the Friday to bring the res. t of the water and the bread loaves to the Spaniard who need. them just as badly_ I a.o gave him a handful of raisins. The Spaniard was very grateful to me, but was so weak and his limbs were . swollen from the rop. that he could not get up on h. f. anymore_ I as. Friday to rub h. han. and feet j.. he had done his father's Friday was .11 so excited that every two or three minutes he would turn arotmd to see how his father was doing. Once he thd not see hin, so he a.. flew to him only to find him resting at the more comfortable bottom of the canoe. I asked the Spaniard to go to the boat with Friday's help and then we would take him to our place. Friday, however, being young a. strong just took die Spaniard on his back and carried h. to the canoe. Then he carefully IMd h. there and arranged so that both he and h. father were comfortable. After that Friday jumped oin of the canoe and guided it along the beach faster than I could walk. 

Chapter 48 
Soon we reached the river where I had first saved Fd.y. When we reached i, Fri.y help. our new guests can of the .at, but they were not able to walk. We had to make a ha.-banow and carry them to our fortification. We encountered another problem when we reach. the fothfication_ Friday's father and the Spaniard could not go over the fence or climb a ladder and 1 thd not want to des, the fence. We made a comfonable tent for than outside the fortification a. prepar. be. and blank. from branch.. As soon as we finished this, I set about cooking thnner. Frithy kill. a young goat and we .iled a soup out of its meat. It was delicious and we all had thnner together in the tent. Fri.y was my intenxeter, because the Span. spoke the language of the savages . well. After that I asked Friday m go back to the beach a. bring us the weapons we had left in our hurry to help the prisoners. .o .k. him to bury the bodies of the killed cannibals die next day. He obeyed my other, so later when I went to the beach I could hardly recognize the place if it wasn't for the big tree .ind which we had lay hidden. The next morning I as. Friday's father what he thought of the savages returning to get their revenge on us. He said he believed they could not have survived the storm, but if they thd, the nearest coast w. the .land of their opponents, so they would not have landed there either. In h. op.on, even if by some happy chance they had reached theft island, they had been asamished to see our gints and would not .ow how we won the battle using them. They would mast probably tell their nation that their friends had been killed by thunder and lightning. He said he heard them ay out M their language that Friday and I were spirits sent from h.ven to plmish them with fire. 

Chapter 49 
I was .11 anidous the savages might return with a bigger army, but nothing of the happened, so after a while I began considering the voyage by sea again. I ask. the Spaniard about his arrival on these islands and he said that he had been . a Spanish ship going to Havana. There were sixteen more Europeans. Sparuar' ds and Ponuguese, on Friday's home island. He told me that five Portuguese sailors were say. from another shipwreck and taken aboard. The stain broke the ship near my island a. some of the men drowned The rest say. themselv. in a boat and were now living w. the sava,. I asked the Spaniard whether they had not tried to undertake another sea voyage, but he said that they had no tools vrith which to build another boat. They did not even have gunpowder because it all spoil. in the water. I asked . opinion on the current situation. Evan if I and the Spanish and Portugu.e sailors somehow managed to reach the continent, I would be in danger of bthng canied into the Inquisition. He assured me that they lived so miserably among the savages that they would never consider betraying me to their officials. The Spanish and Portuguese sailors had no cloth. left, no food or weapons, so that returnMg to their fellowmen was completely out of gu.don. He was convinced that they would do anything to go home and would treat me very well for my help. Hearing all this and observing the Spaniard for some time, I decided that it would be better if he and Friday's father return to their island and Mform the other Europeans of our plan. A. that, they wottld bring them all here, where .th my tools and lalowledge and with their help we could build a vessel to carry us to the continent It was then that the Sp.. suggested somethMg else. He persuaded me that it would be better to delay the execution of d. plan for at le. half a year, because there was not enough food for fifteen more men on my island. We would not have enough food to eat while builthng the ship, .d much less to take vrith us for die .g voyage. 

Chapter SO 
The Spaniard advised me CO plant more com a. he and Friday's father helped us expand the gardens. All four of us managed to sow so much that we had just enough to eat until the crops were ready. Friday, die Spaniard and I caught more kids and Mcreased our hettl by more than 20 kids. We also several dmes more gra, than we ever had before We started preparing the ma.. for the boat. We chose a few trees and I show. them how to cut them to form planks. The harv.t came and we had plenty of food. We had so much com, rice and barley that we needed more baskets and pots to store it all. As it tumed an, the Spaniard was very skilful at this. Once all the harvest was gather. and the food was securely MO. in my cave, the Spaniard and Friday's father were free to go back and bring here 'whoever wan. to follcnv me. I asked them to make the Europeans swear they would not hurt or go against me in any way before talcing them on board and to my island. We agreed on a secret signal which they should make before approaching the coast, so we would know it was them. I gave them food .d two loaded guns in case they were attacked again. Then, taking one of the canoes that they had come in prisoners, they sailed away. 

Chapter 51 
Eight days had ,sed since they left when something unexpect. happened. One morning Friday woke me up to tell me they had returned. I was so excited and M my hum! I forgot to take any weapons with me. From the top of the nearest hill I saw a boat vrith a sail on the horizon, but coming from a completely different threction. It immetha.y occurred to me that these were not the people we were expecting. I return. to the fortification and took my telescope. With its help I discover. an anchored ship close to the shore. By construMon, the ship seemed English and so did the boat. I w. confused. On one hand, I was happy to find fellow Englishmen after twenty-seven years on . island. On the other hand, I was concern. because the island was quite out of the way of any English ship. Recendy the, had been no storms which could have taken them here Perhaps they were pirates or murderers and were hidMg here? All this made nae very mutious. Friday and remai. hiding, observing them for a while The boat approach. the heath and count. eleven men, some of wthch I had taken to be English, some Dutch. It wasn't long before i realized that, in fact, they were all Englishmen. Three of the men were unarmed and bound and soon as the boat reached the sand, five of the others took them to the beach. Two of the prisoners were caLm and composed, but the third one was making passionate gestures. He seemed desperate .d was begging the ones in the boat for something. On seeing this, Friday turned to me and pointed out that it seemed Englishmen were also ea.g fellow men.
